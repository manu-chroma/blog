# Google Summer of Code 2017: Final Report
by [Manvendra Singh](github.com/manu-chroma)

Hey everyone! I'm Manvendra, a Google Summer of Code '17 student developer. This summer, I worked on [Common Workflow Langaguge Project](github.com/common-workflow-language/) which comes under [OBF Org](https://www.open-bio.org/wiki/Main_Page). This is a summary report on what I managed to do in the last three months. 

My major deliverables were:
- Adding Python 3 compatibility to [CWL Tool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool), [Schema Salad](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/schema_salad) and [CWL Test](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltest) projects.
- Improving [``mypy``](http://mypy-lang.org/) annotations and upgrading mypy dependency for CWL Tool and Schema Salad. 
- Reducing issue backlog and misc enhancements.

It was a great experience and I got to learn a lot about python, mypy, debugging effectively and several libraries (both standard and third-party) and alot of other things. I was the highest committer in Schema Salad and CWl Tool from the start of my coding period (End of April) to Mid-August: [commit](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/graphs/contributors?from=2017-05-30&to=2017-08-17&type=c) [graph](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/schema_salad/graphs/contributors?from=2017-05-05&to=2017-08-17&type=c), [commits to](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/commits/master?author=manu-chroma) [master](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/schema_salad/commits/master?author=manu-chroma)

## Learnings and takeaways

I got alot of experience in Software Engineering and learned about Python and related tools. I read lots and lots of blog posts when searching and trying to find best pratices for coding. @todo:improve: 

- Used Python debugger alot. Explored a new way to find and squash errors. Was really helpful all along. -->

@todo: caption for tweet\: one of the highpoints of my work: shipping work. or something better?:
 -->

#### Phase 1: 7 weeks

- Make Schema Salad code Py3 comaptible. The majority of the changes were made in this Mega PR.
- Improved ``mypy`` annotaions and took care of other bugs along the way. 
- Worked on CWL Py3 comptibility: Again majority of change came in a Mega PR: 
- Fixed ``mypy`` annotations and upgraded to ``v.511``
- Run ``mypy`` in Python 3 mode
- Dealt with Apache Avro issues @todo: add pr link:
- Fixed failing unit tests
- Fixed failing conformace tests
- Added Py3 compat to CWL Test

#### Phase 2: 4 weeks 

I tracked my ``Phase 2`` using Manvendra's Issue Tracker using GitHub project. @todo:https://github.com/orgs/common-workflow-language/projects/3?fullscreen=true: This included addressing very specific issues and enhancements: 

- Better errors for invalid ``cwlVerions``
- Fix ``node:slim`` check and download condition
- Update Jenkins script to add Python 3 conformance testing
- Fix Windows installtion error
- Packed Workflow bug related to ``cwlVersion``
- Add classname support for XML output report on CWL Test
- Improve README: Improve installtion instructions and formatting
- Deprecate CWL ``draft 2,3,4`` support on CWL Tool @todo:make better:

### Challenges

Some of the challenges I found all along the way

- User guide is rich but codebase is relatively less documented. Major challenge was to alot of stuff figure myself.
- Strings needed to be handled correctly: differentiating between binary (data) and ASCII/unicode strings. Related blog post: 
- Dependency upgrade: Getting Apache Avro working under Python 3 runttime turned out to be a big challenge: Related Issue @todo:addlink:
- Fixing failing conformance was also a challenge, but always interesting one. Even though conformance tests cover less than half codebase of what unit tests do: they helped uncover alot of subtle and integration testing bugs while porting.
- Dealing with Makefiles and bash scripting

## Future Work

I've a few Work In Progress PR's currently which I plan to complete. 

- Add contributing guide for CWL Tool
PR: [#508](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/508)
- Config coveralls to measure code coverage diff on PR's
PR: [#526](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/526)
- Deprecate previous drafts
PR: [#520](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/520)
- Fix Makefile target for conformance code coverage
Related issue: [#334](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/issues/334)

## Acknowledgement

<!-- I would like to thank a bunch of people for helping me out throughout my journey. @todo:formatting fix: I feel, this is probably one of the best part of open source dev to see other people willingly help out each other and collaborate with barely knowing the person or their background. I'd like to thank my mentors Michael Crusoe, Anton Khodak and Jaanke van Der @todo:fix names and add links: :add content from mail and evals: 
I am very grateful to Michael. He was very responsive and helpful all along. He ended up giving very useful insights at alot of times to help me fix the problems. @todo:mention the community as well:

I would also like to thank Alexandr who helped me in mypy debugging and wrote a few stub files, Kapil who reviwed some of my code and I reviwed his, Petr for hanging around and giving ocassional advice on various crucial decsions. I would also like to thank the entire ``mypy`` community: they were super active on Gitter and really helped around and provided some guidance in porting decsion and getting ``mypy`` running on both Python 2 and 3. 

@todo:how to end the post: @refator: I feel I've added some value to the project through my work. I was able to sucessfully deliver my project objectives and @todo: software got better and ms windows support: :and the end:  -->
