Coming to this week, it's mostly been getting a huge chunk of my work ready to be merged and finally getting it merged.

In the last meeting, my mentor - [Micheal](https://github.com/mr-c) mentioned the plans for releasing the next version of CWL Specification ``v1.0.1`` as a "errata / clarification" spec revision to be released by the end of the July and resultantly, cwltool will be modified heavily in the process.
Thus, it was important to start getting everything merged.

I started out by merging my two separate branches ``mypy_updates`` and ``modernize`` and pulling upstream changes and fixing merge conflicts. Micheal was quick enough to respond and we finally got [my schema_salad PR](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/442) merged mid-week. Happy to share that we have started using Python 3 compatible schema_salad ``v2.6`` in cwltool now.

As discussed in the [previous blog post](https://manu-chroma.github.io/blog/gsoc/'17/2017/06/19/week-3.html), using ``unicode_literals`` had its benefits but it was breaking mypy badly. The problem mainly emerges from the fact that many typeshed stubs only accept `str` when ascii-only `unicode` values also work at runtime with Python 2.7 stdlib. This causes a lot of problems with code using `unicode_literals` since generally, most literals will have `unicode` as their type due to the ``__future__`` import.  

I had previously [reported the errors](https://github.com/python/typeshed/issues/1411) related to it here and very recently [mentioned it again](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3619). This time around Guido himself replied:

I discussed the same with Micheal, and we decided on dropping ``unicode_literals``.

You can read more about the mypy errors due to ``unicode_literals`` at: [mypy/issues/3619](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/3619) and [mypy/issues/1954](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/1954)

This meant changing mypy annotations again and fixing up things. Luckily, it didn't take much time and I finally got my [PR for cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/442) ready by the weekend. We plan on getting it merged early this week.

This marks a lot of compatibility code merged and ready to be used in production. I am targeting on getting Apache Avro issues resolved soon which is the only major bottleneck that remains on the road to Python 3 now.
