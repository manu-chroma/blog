Hey everyone, I'm happy to announce that I got selected in GSoC '17 and will be working on improving Common Worklow Language reference implementation: [cwltool](github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) this summer. Just like last year, Common Workflow Language has partcipated under the umbrella org [Open Bioinformatics Foundation](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5447537956749312/).

Checkout my [project proposal here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5468194121711616)

Looking forward to an exciting and productive summer! :grin:
