Hey, results are out and I will be working on on improving Common Worklow Language reference implementation [cwltool](github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) this summer. CWL falls under umbrella org Open Bioinformatics Foundation.

Checkout my [project proposal here](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5468194121711616)

Looking forward to a great and productive summer! :grin:
