Few improvements to the project this week:

- #### Enable Python 3 conformance testing on Jenkins Server
This is a result of series of PR's. [First](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/465) [two](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/473) by [Micheal](https://github.com/mr-c) and [last one](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/505) by me.
Now Jenkins will run the conformance tests in both Python 2.7 and Python 3 runtimes. This ensures stronger feedback loop and will force future patches to not break Python 3 compatibilty on these tests.

- #### Fixing MS Windows quirk when installing cwltool
When `\tmp` folder is not present in the root of `Drive:` where we're trying to install cwltool in Python 3, `pip install` throws an installation error. This is because `\tmp` path is hard-coded in the source of ``autotranslate`` module which is used for converting ``avro-python2`` during runtime.
It is also used by [conformance tests](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/issues/499#issuecomment-319435746) making this patch crucial. [Kapil](https:github.com/kapilkd13) is helping me out with testing this one before final merge. Related PR: [schema_salad/pull/125](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/schema_salad/pull/125)    

- #### Adding CONTRIBUTING guide to CWL Tool
I've created a [WIP PR](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/508) for cwltool specific CONTRIBUTING guide. We've outlined a rough guide for any potential contributers to help setup dev environment and contribute. This guide was orignally written by [Farah Khan](https://github.com/farahzkhan) and I made a few minor improvements to it. I will probably like to make it more detailed before getting it merged into the master.

__ToDo:__
My progress in this week was slow relative to other weeks.
I would like to pick up pace from this week until the end of coding period.
