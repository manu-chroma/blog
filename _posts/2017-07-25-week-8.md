I spent this week going through [CWL Tool issue tracker](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/issues) and solving a few. Most of these issues were related to improving user experience by providing better warnings/fatal error description or generally fixing logical bugs in the codebase.

### PR's I made since last blog post:


| PR  |  Description                                                                     |
|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [#496](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/496) |  _feat: Pass group id (GID) in --user flag when calling docker run_                |
| [#494](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/494) |  _sandboxjs.py: fix checking condition for node:slim_                              |
| [#491](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/491) |  _load_tool: when no version or incorrect cwlVersion is found, create fatal error_ |
| [#497](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/497) |  _main.py: print complete pack dict_                                               |
