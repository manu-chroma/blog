I am happy to announce CWL reference runner, [cwltool](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool) now supports Python 3. Also, with this [PR merged](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/475), we will very soon be supporting MS Windows, courtesy to [Kapil Kumar](https://github.com/kapilkd13) and [Micheal Crusoe](https://github.com/mr-c).

There were a lot of misc tasks I covered this week. I'm gonna quickly go over them:  

- **Python 3**: Added py3 tests to tox and turned on travis CI; PR: [cwltool/pull/464](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/464)
- **Apache Avro solution that works:** Utilising the convinence of open source, we ended up [forking avro](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/avro) repo and did minimal changes to make it work with our Python 3 implementation. There is a PR: [avro/pull/235](https://github.com/apache/avro/pull/235) and [discussion](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-2046) pending which tries to get these changes merged upstream.
- **Upgrade mypy to v0.520**: New version of mypy was released last week and I thought it was a good time to make PR to support it, given the hosts of improvements each new mypy release brings. PRs: [#121](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/schema_salad/pull/121) and [#461](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/pull/461)
- **Upgrading CWL Test**: We use CWL Test to run the conformace test suite when building cwltool PRs. For integrating Python 3 conformace tests on Jenkins, I made a quick PR to do minimal changes and make CWL Test Python 3 compatible. PR: [cwltest/pull/20](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltest/pull/20)
- **Using io.open instead of builtin open()**: PR link: This ensures more consistant behaviour in file handling across  [commit](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/commit/69d41788b917e8c95d88f1bd562c1443cc9e7eee)

I still have more than a month left in my GSoC coding period. I will mostly be working on clearing up issues on GitHub in the remaining time period. This sounds vague and that's why I have created [an issue](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwltool/issues/463) to track the issues I am working on and my progress regarding the same.

ToDo next week:
Solve a few impactful issues :bowtie:
